# Duplicates_remover
Having duplicate images in a dataset creates a two kinds of problems:  
  1. It introduces bias into your dataset, giving your deep neural network additional opportunities to learn patterns specific to the duplicates. 
  2. It hurts the ability of your model to generalize to new images outside of what it was trained on.
Identifying duplicates in a large dataset manually is very time consuming and error-prone process. This project aims to remove duplicate images from the dataset.
